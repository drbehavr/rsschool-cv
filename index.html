		<h2>&lt;About me&gt;</h2>
		<p>I am extremely motivated for career change goal. <br> During many years I had worked as a qualified doctor. At my workplace, I tried to automate routine processes using PC and successfully saved time for main job, but sometimes I worked on outdated equipment and inconvenient applications with poor interface. It made me look for information about the process of developing such applications. <br> My keen interest in field of technologies led me to think about web develop. In 2021 I took the first step towards my goal -  I started studying programming (HTML CSS JS from scratch). and later I joined the course by Rsschool. <br><br>
			I want to be a front-end and  bring value to interesting projects (including projects related to medicine)<br><br>
						I believe in the future, technologies will penetrate into every area-medicine, science, education etc. in every country, except Russia(joke). It is necessary to learn new technologies for everyone. <br>This field provides possibilities for professional growth, besides there are many opportunities for self-education and a  community of developers. It really attractive for me.
						<br>I am open to get new knowledge, skills.  
						<br><br>
						My interests are tasty food(a lot of tasty food), travel, video and mobile photo,  books, bike , ice skating.
