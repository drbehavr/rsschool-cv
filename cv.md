## About me

> I am extremely motivated for career change goal. During many years I had worked as a qualified doctor. At my workplace, I tried to automate routine processes using PC and successfully saved time for main job, but sometimes I worked on outdated equipment and soft with poor interface. My keen interest in field of technologies led me to think about web develop. In 2021 I took the first step towards my goal - I started studying programming (HTML CSS JS from scratch). and later I joined the course by Rsschool. I want to be a front-end and bring value to interesting projects (including projects related to medicine) I believe in the future, technologies will penetrate into every area-medicine, science, education etc. in every country, except Russia(joke). It is necessary to learn new technologies for everyone. This field provides possibilities for professional growth, besides there are many opportunities for self-education and a community of developers. It really attractive for me.
